#### Firstly Â 
Actually, I use Facebook and Instagram very frequently. In my previous company or when learning something new or coding, I always had a Facebook tab open in my browser.

**It became a habit because as a coder, we are online 24/7**. However, upon joining my current company, I realized that not everyone uses Facebook or Messenger. Instead, we communicate through Teams for work-related matters and engage in private chats on Skype.

I know some people who are very successful in business, they don't use social network. Now, I find this to be very true. When people focus on something, they often don't have time for social networks, even for (KOL) and Content Creators

#### Social network - FB, INS is a place to brag, show off ?

For me, when I use Social Networks, I want to post something about myself. A success, something cool or money...
And, in Vietnam when I scroll newfeeed everyday ! 96.69% users show something cool about them.

However, I think it is not wrong ! It is nature. Me too !
But for me, **if I want to show off things I did, It is not worthy ! But, If is worthy thing I want to do, I don't need to show off !**

#### FB - 96% users is Taxi Driver

If you want to search for something useful on FB, that's bad! There aren't many good articles here. People talk a lot about AI, Bitcoin, Coin,... Oh fuck! 96% of the people posting this are 'taxi drivers' (people who don't understand anything but like to show)

###### This is my opinion, I don't want discuss or debate
